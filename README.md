One of the most profound enigmas that plays a crucial role in particle physics is the matter-antimatter asymmetry. Since the Standard Model (SM) falls short to explain this inequality, an additional source of the Charge-Parity (CP) violation beyond the Standard Model (BSM) framework should exist. The Higgs boson with its natural property becomes an important candidate to investigate this mystery. Employing the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) during this research, the ggF production mode was analysed with a decay mode $H \rightarrow WW^*\rightarrow l\nu l\nu$, where $\ell = \mu,e$, to set constraints on the CP-odd coupling $C_{H\tilde G}$. Machine learning (ML) was applied for this purpose using two techniques; ALICES and SALLY that employ simulated data to train the Neural Network (NN) to compute estimations of the likelihood ratio without the requirement of having approximations of the parton shower and detector response. SALLY allowed for stronger bounds on $C_{H\tilde G}$ than using the classical methods based on histograms for Signal Only events. However, the NN struggled to learn the data when introducing the backgrounds, making ML less effective than the classical method using histograms. These results might be a fruitful area to examine machine learning-based inference techniques in probing CP-violating effects and refine constraints using future work, hopefully to search for the unknown beyond. 

In this github, the used code is presented.
